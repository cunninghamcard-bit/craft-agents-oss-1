# Craft Agent

A Claude Code-like agent for Craft documents using the Anthropic SDK and Craft MCP.

## Features

- **Claude Code-like Experience**: Streaming responses, tool visualization, and real-time updates
- **Craft MCP Integration**: Access to 32+ Craft document tools (blocks, collections, search, tasks)
- **Subagents**: Define specialized agents in Craft documents with custom instructions, MCP servers, and REST APIs
- **Dynamic API Integration**: Automatically extract REST APIs from documentation and create flexible tools
- **Rich Terminal UI**: Built with Ink (React for CLIs)
- **Ultrathink Mode**: Type "ultrathink" in your message for extended thinking
- **Command History**: Navigate previous inputs with arrow keys
- **Slash Commands**: `/help`, `/tools`, `/setup`, `/clear`, `/agent`, `/info`, `/exit`
- **Interactive Setup**: First-run wizard to configure API keys and MCP connection

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.0+
- [Anthropic API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- Craft MCP server running (with valid workflow link)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-terminal-agent.git
cd craft-tui-agent

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Install globally (creates 'craft' command)
bun link
```

After linking, you can run `craft` from anywhere in your terminal.

## First Run Setup

On first run, you'll be guided through an interactive setup wizard:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Craft Agent - Setup                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
Step 1 of 4: Welcome

Welcome to Craft Agent!
You'll need:
• An Anthropic API key (from console.anthropic.com)
• Your Craft MCP server URL (workflow link)
• A bearer token for authentication

Press Enter to continue...
```

The wizard will ask for:
1. **Anthropic API Key** - Get one from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. **Craft MCP URL** - Your workflow link URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/v1/links/abc123/mcp`)
3. **Bearer Token** - Authentication token for your MCP server

Configuration is saved to `~/.craft-agent/config.json`

**Security**: All sensitive credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens) are stored in an AES-256-GCM encrypted file at `~/.craft-agent/credentials.enc`. The encryption key is derived from your machine identity using PBKDF2, providing the same security model as OS keychains without requiring system keychain prompts.

## Usage

```bash
# Run the agent (shows setup wizard on first run)
craft

# Override config with CLI options
craft --url http://localhost:3000/v1/links/abc123/mcp

# Show help
craft --help

# Development mode (auto-reload)
bun dev
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show help message |
| `/tools` | List available Craft MCP tools |
| `/agent` | List, activate, or deactivate subagents |
| `/info` | Show active agent info and available tools |
| `/plan` | Plan mode menu (start, plans, view, approve, cancel) |
| `/setup` | Re-run the configuration wizard |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation |
| `/exit` | Exit application |
| `Ctrl+C` | Interrupt / Exit |
| `Up/Down` | Navigate command history |
| `SHIFT+TAB` | Toggle Plan Mode |

## Headless Mode (Non-Interactive)

Headless mode allows running Craft Agent in scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and automation workflows without user interaction.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Execute a single prompt and exit
craft --print "List all documents in my workspace"

# With JSON output for parsing
craft --print "Search for meeting notes" --output-format json

# Streaming JSON for real-time processing
craft --print "Summarize today's tasks" --output-format stream-json

# Use a specific workspace
craft --print "What tasks are due?" --workspace my-workspace

# Use a specific subagent
craft --print "Search for TypeScript tutorials" --agent researcher
```

### CLI Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--print, -p <query>` | Execute prompt and exit (enables headless mode) |
| `--output-format <fmt>` | Output: `text` (default), `json`, `stream-json` |
| `--permission-policy` | Bash permissions: `deny-all` (default), `allow-safe`, `allow-all` |
| `--session-resume` | Resume last session instead of starting fresh |
| `--session <id>` | Use explicit session ID (for workflow management) |
| `--workspace, -w <name>` | Use specific workspace |
| `--agent, -a <name>` | Activate specific subagent |
| `--model, -m <model>` | Override model selection |

### Permission Policies

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `deny-all` | Block all bash commands (safest, default) |
| `allow-safe` | Allow read-only commands (ls, cat, grep, find, etc.) |
| `allow-all` | Allow all commands (use with caution) |

### Output Formats

**text** (default): Plain text response
```bash
craft --print "What's in my inbox?"
# Output: You have 3 tasks in your inbox...
```

**json**: Structured JSON with response, tool calls, and usage
```bash
craft --print "List tasks" --output-format json
# Output: {"success":true,"response":"...","toolCalls":[...],"usage":{...}}
```

**stream-json**: Newline-delimited JSON events for real-time processing
```bash
craft --print "Summarize document" --output-format stream-json
# Output: {"type":"status","message":"Processing..."}
#         {"type":"text_delta","text":"The document..."}
#         {"type":"complete","result":{...}}
```

### Plan Mode Disabled

In headless mode, plan mode tools (`EnterCraftAgentsPlanMode`, `ExitCraftAgentsPlanMode`, `CraftAskUserQuestion`) are automatically disabled. The agent executes tasks directly without planning phases, which is appropriate for non-interactive automation.

### Session Management

By default, each headless run starts with a fresh session. For multi-turn conversations:

```bash
# Resume the last session
craft --print "Continue where we left off" --session-resume

# Use explicit session ID (for external workflow management)
craft --print "Step 1" --session my-workflow-123
craft --print "Step 2" --session my-workflow-123
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Error (auth required, agent not found, execution error) |

## Plan Mode

Plan Mode is a structured approach to handling complex, multi-step tasks. Instead of immediately executing actions, the agent first creates a plan describing **what** it will do, gets user approval, and then executes.

### Why Plan Mode?

Without planning, agents often:
- Execute prematurely before fully understanding requirements
- Make unnecessary API calls that could have been avoided
- Lack transparency about intended actions

### How It Works

```
Enter Plan Mode (SHIFT+TAB) → Clarify Requirements → Design Plan → User Review → Execute
```

1. **Enter Plan Mode**: Press `SHIFT+TAB` or type `/plan start`
2. **Clarify Requirements**: Agent uses `CraftAskUserQuestion` for interactive clarification
3. **Design Plan**: Agent describes steps without executing them
4. **User Review**: Approve, refine, or cancel via PlanReview UI
5. **Execute**: After approval, agent executes the plan

### What's Blocked During Planning

| Blocked | Allowed |
|---------|---------|
| API calls (`api_*`) | `CraftAskUserQuestion` |
| `Bash`, `Write`, `Edit` | `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` |
| Craft MCP write tools | `WebSearch`, `WebFetch` (sparingly) |
| `Task`, `TaskOutput` | Craft MCP read tools |

### Usage

```bash
SHIFT+TAB      # Toggle plan mode
/plan start    # Enter plan mode
/plan plans    # View, load, or delete saved plans
/plan view     # View current plan details
/plan approve  # Approve and execute current plan
/plan cancel   # Exit plan mode
```

**Plan Selector Controls:**
- `↑↓` - Navigate plans
- `Enter` - Load selected plan
- `Space` - Toggle selection for deletion
- `D/d` - Delete selected plans (with confirmation)
- `Esc` - Clear selections or close

The header shows `PLAN` indicator when active.

## Subagents

Subagents are specialized agents defined in Craft documents. They extend the base agent with custom instructions, MCP servers, and REST APIs.

### Defining a Subagent

Create a Craft document with an "Instructions" section containing the agent's system prompt. You can also include:

**MCP Servers** (HTTP/HTTPS only):
```yaml
servers:
  - name: myserver
    url: https://example.com/mcp
```

**REST APIs** (detected from various sources):
```bash
# Curl examples
curl -X POST https://api.exa.ai/search \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query": "search query", "numResults": 10}'

# Or fetch/axios calls, inline API docs, or links to API documentation
```

The extractor will automatically:
- Detect APIs from curl examples, fetch calls, axios requests, or API documentation
- Extract authentication methods (header, bearer, query, basic, or public)
- Generate comprehensive markdown documentation for Claude
- Create a single flexible tool (`api_{name}`) that Claude uses with the documentation
- Prompt for API credentials on first activation (with custom labels when provided)

### Using Subagents

```bash
/agent              # List available subagents
/agent myagent      # Activate a subagent
/agent off          # Deactivate current subagent
/info               # Show active agent info and tools
```

### Large Response Handling & Intent-Aware Summarization

Tool responses (from MCP tools, REST APIs, etc.) that exceed ~60KB are automatically summarized using Claude Haiku to prevent context overflow.

**The Problem:** A generic summarizer doesn't know what information is relevant. If you ask "What did John say about the budget?" and the tool returns a 100-page document, how does the summarizer know to focus on John's budget comments?

**The Solution:** The `_intent` field is enforced via schema modification. The fetch interceptor injects `_intent` into every MCP tool's schema in the Anthropic API request, so the model MUST include it.

```javascript
mcp__craft__document_search({
  query: "Q3 budget",
  _intent: "Finding John's budget comments in Q3 meeting notes"
})
```

This intent is:
1. **Enforced** - Schema modification ensures the model includes it
2. **Displayed in the UI** - You see exactly what the model is doing
3. **Passed to the summarizer** - Haiku knows to focus on John + budget
4. **Clean** - Stripped before forwarding to MCP server

**Example UI Output:**
```
⠋ Craft Read Document Finding John's budget comments in Q3 meeting...
✓ Craft Read Document Finding John's budget comments... (2.3s)
```

This system ensures large documents are summarized with the right focus, and users always know what the agent is doing.

## Example Prompts

```
Show me today's daily note
Search for meeting notes about project X
Add a task: Review PR #123
List all my collections
What tasks do I have due this week?
```

## Development

```bash
# Type checking
bun run typecheck

# Run in watch mode
bun dev

# Debug logging (writes to /tmp/craft-debug.log)
craft --debug
```

### Debugging

Debug logging is disabled by default. Enable it with the `--debug` flag:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run the app with debug logging
craft --debug

# Terminal 2: Watch logs in real-time
tail -f /tmp/craft-debug.log
```

This two-terminal setup lets you interact with the app while seeing debug output stream in real-time.



## Releasing

Releases are built and deployed via GitHub Actions.

### Creating a Release

1. Go to [Actions → Build and Upload](https://github.com/lukilabs/craft-terminal-agent/actions/workflows/build-and-upload.yml)
2. Click **"Run workflow"**
3. Enter the version number (e.g., `1.0.1`)
4. Options:
   - **"Also upload to /latest folder"** → Check this to make it the default version users get
   - **"Also upload install.sh to bucket root"** → Check this if you updated the install script
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

The workflow will:
- Build native binaries for all platforms (darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-x64, linux-arm64)
- Upload tarballs and manifest to `agents.craft.do/<version>/`
- Optionally update `/latest` to point to this version

### Testing a Release

After the workflow completes, users can install with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://agents.craft.do/install.sh | bash
```

### Testing a Fresh Install

Use the uninstall script to completely remove Craft Agent:

```bash
bash scripts/uninstall.sh
```

This removes:
- Binary from `~/.local/bin/craft`
- Bun-linked version (if exists)
- Config and credentials (`~/.craft-agent`)
- PATH entries from shell configs (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc.)

Then open a **new terminal** and run the install script to test.

### Keyboard Handling

When handling Ctrl+key shortcuts in Ink's raw terminal mode, always check for both forms:
- High-level: `key.ctrl && input === 'c'`
- Raw character: `input === '\x03'` (Ctrl+C = ASCII 3)

Different terminals may deliver only the raw character without setting `key.ctrl`. See `apps/tui/src/keyboard/mappings.ts` for canonical implementations.

## Ultrathink Mode

Include the word "ultrathink" anywhere in your message to enable extended thinking mode. This sets `maxThinkingTokens` based on the model, allowing Claude to think more deeply about complex problems.

**Thinking tokens by model:**
| Model | Thinking Tokens |
|-------|-----------------|
| Opus | 64,000 |
| Sonnet | 64,000 |
| Haiku | 8,000 |

**How it works:**
- The keyword "ultrathink" is detected (case-insensitive) and stripped from the message sent to Claude
- The word appears with a cyan→magenta→cyan gradient while typing
- During processing, a gradient "ultrathink" label appears in the thinking indicator
- Extended thinking is single-shot (only applies to that message)

**When to use:**
- Complex reasoning or multi-step problems
- Code architecture decisions
- Difficult debugging scenarios
- Tasks requiring deep analysis

**Example:**
```
ultrathink How should I refactor this authentication system to support OAuth2?
```

## Extended Prompt Cache

The app can extend Anthropic's prompt cache TTL from 5 minutes to 1 hour, beneficial for longer conversations where you may not respond within 5 minutes.

**Default behavior:** 1-hour cache is enabled for **Opus models only**. Other models use the standard 5-minute cache.

**Pricing:**
- 5-minute cache: 1.25x write cost, 0.1x read cost
- 1-hour cache: 2x write cost, 0.1x read cost

The 2x write cost is negligible for expensive Opus models but significant for cheaper models like Sonnet.

**To override:**
Add to `~/.craft-agent/config.json`:
```json
{ "extendedCacheTtl": true }   // Force 1h for all models
{ "extendedCacheTtl": false }  // Force 5m for all models
```

## Trace Viewer & Langsmith Upload

A standalone utility to view SDK session transcripts and upload them to Langsmith for analysis.

```bash
# List recent sessions
bun tools/langsmith-upload.ts

# View last session (ergonomic - no ID needed)
bun tools/langsmith-upload.ts view

# View specific session (partial ID match)
bun tools/langsmith-upload.ts view abc123

# Output as JSON
bun tools/langsmith-upload.ts view --json

# Upload to Langsmith
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=ls-... bun tools/langsmith-upload.ts upload

# Upload with custom project name
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=ls-... bun tools/langsmith-upload.ts upload --project "My Project"
```

Session transcripts are stored by the Claude Agent SDK at:
```
~/.claude/projects/-{encoded-project-path}/{sessionId}.jsonl
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` - Required for upload (get from Langsmith settings)
- `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` - Optional, defaults to `https://api.smith.langchain.com`
